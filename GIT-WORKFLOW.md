# Writing code:

- Make changes in a new branch (```git checkout -b mybranch```)
- Test using PHPUnit and the build environment
- Push your branch to GitHub and create a PR
- Have someone else test and merge the PR
- Please do NOT commit directly to master
- Ideally, only push when your branch builds and works
